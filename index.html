        <h2>Welcome to the MailChimp Content Style Guide</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>This style guide was created for MailChimp employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other content and communications teams too.</p>
        <h3>If you work at MailChimp</h3>
        <p>This is our company style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for MailChimp.</p>
        <p>This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.</p>
        <p>We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.</p>
        <h3>If you work at another organization</h3>
        <p>We invite you to use and adapt this style guide as you see fit. It’s completely public and available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license. All we ask is that you credit MailChimp.</p>
        <p>We welcome any feedback for improving the guide.</p>

        <h2>Writing Goals and Principles</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><b>Empower.</b> Help people understand MailChimp by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products.</li>
          <li><b>Respect.</b> Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them.</li>
          <li><b>Educate.</b> Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything
            you know</li>
          <li><b>Guide.</b> Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers. Whether you’re leading them through our marketing website, apps, or educational materials, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.</li>
          <li><b>Speak truth.</b> Understand MailChimp's place in our users’ lives. Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on our real strengths.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Clear.</b> Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.</li>
          <li><b>Useful.</b> Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?</li>
          <li><b>Friendly.</b> Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.</li>
          <li><b>Appropriate.</b> Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Voice and Tone</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to MailChimp. To learn more about how we adapt our tone
          for different situations, check out our <a href="http://voiceandtone.com/">Voice and Tone guide.</a></p>
        <p>What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a
          meeting with your boss.</p>
        <p>Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.</p>
        <p>The same is true for MailChimp. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.</p>
        <h3>Voice</h3>
        <p>MailChimp’s voice is human. It’s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. Our priority is explaining our products and helping our users get their work done so they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing
          them.
        </p>
        <p>One way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn’t. MailChimp’s voice is:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Fun but not silly</li>
          <li>Confident but not cocky</li>
          <li>Smart but not stodgy</li>
          <li>Informal but not sloppy</li>
          <li>Helpful but not overbearing</li>
          <li>Expert but not bossy</li>
          <li>Weird but not inappropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tone</h3>
        <p>MailChimp’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help
          on Twitter? Are they curious about a post on our blog? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.</p>
        <p>MailChimp has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.</p>
        <h3>Style tips</h3>
        <p>Here are a few key elements of writing MailChimp’s voice. For more, see the Grammar and mechanics section.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Active voice Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.</li>
          <li>Avoid slang and jargon Write in plain English.</li>
          <li>Write positively Use positive language rather than negative language.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A note about Freddie</h3>
        <p>Freddie is MailChimp's mascot. He’s been around in various forms since the company's beginning, and he captures the spirit of our brand’s personality. He smiles, winks, and sometimes high-fives, but he does not talk. Don't write in his voice.
          For more on how to use Freddie, see our Brand Assets.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="writing_about_people">
      <header>
        <h2>Writing About People</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>We write the same way we build apps: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being
          aware of the impact of your language will help make MailChimp a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources
          for further learning.</p>
        <h3>Age</h3>
        <p>Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it is relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>The CEO, 16, just got her driver’s license.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disability</h3>
        <p>Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: ”she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.”</p>
        <p>When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.” “Handicapped parking” is OK.</p>
        <h3>Gender and sexuality</h3>
        <p>Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.”</p>
        <p>Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”</p>
        <p>It’s OK to use “they” as a singular pronoun.</p>
        <p>Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>lesbian</li>
          <li>gay</li>
          <li>bisexual</li>
          <li>transgender (never "transgendered")</li>
          <li>trans</li>
          <li>queer</li>
          <li>LGBT</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don’t use these words in reference to LGBT people or communities:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>homosexual</li>
          <li>lifestyle</li>
          <li>preference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don’t use “same-sex” marriage, unless the distinction is relevant to what you’re writing. (Avoid “gay marriage.”) Otherwise, it’s just “marriage.”</p>
        <p>When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.</p>
        <h3>Hearing</h3>
        <p>Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”</p>
        <h3>Heritage and nationality</h3>
        <p>Don't use hyphens when referring to someone with dual heritage or nationality. For example, use "Asian American" instead of "Asian-American."</p>
        <h3>Medical conditions</h3>
        <p>Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.</p>
        <p>If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”</p>
        <h3>Mental and cognitive conditions</h3>
        <p>Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.</p>
        <p>Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.</p>
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.</p>

        <h2>Web Elements</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>Every piece of content we publish is supported by a number of smaller pieces. This section lays out our style in regards to these web elements, and explains our approach to the tricky art of SEO.</p>
        <h3>There are a few examples of web elements:</h3>
        <p>
          <code>var person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  gender: 'male',
  interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
  bio: function() {
    alert(this.name[0] + ' ' + this.name[1] + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. He likes ' + this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.');
  },
  greeting: function() {
    alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');
  }
};</code>
          <code>person.name
person.name[0]
person.age
person.interests[1]
person.bio()
person.greeting()</code>
          <code>var objectName = {
  member1Name: member1Value,
  member2Name: member2Value,
  member3Name: member3Value
};</code>
          <code>person.age
person.interests[1]
person.bio()</code>
          <code>name : {
  first: 'Bob',
  last: 'Smith'
},</code>
